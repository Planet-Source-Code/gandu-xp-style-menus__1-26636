About cPopMenu
The cPopMenu control is a really simple way to get icons into a VB 
project's menus. It also allows you to create arbitrary new submenus, 
gives you control over the system menu and has some useful new events 
indicating when menu items are highlighted and exited.

This project contains the full cPopMenu source code and is provided
for your information only.  It should NOT be used to build modified
versions the cPopMenu control for distribution purposes.  If you want
to build a modified version of the control, make sure you change the
filename and control class name before doing so.  Any bugs or problems
should be reported to the author (steve@dogma.demon.co.uk) for 
incorporation into future releases.

Installation Requirements
cPopMenu requires Visual Basic 5 with at least Service Pack 2 applied
and the SSubTmr.DLL (available from www.dogma.demon.co.uk)
